# Horse or Human Image Classification using TensorFlow
This project aims to classify images as either containing a horse or a human using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented with TensorFlow. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of horses and humans, achieving efficient classification accuracy.
## Project Overview
The project utilizes the power of CNNs, a class of deep neural networks well-suited for image classification tasks. TensorFlow, a widely used deep learning framework, is employed for building and training the model. The dataset consists of labeled images of horses and humans, enabling the model to learn distinctive features of each class.
## Key Features
**Convolutional Neural Network:** Implemented a CNN architecture to effectively extract features from input images.
**TensorFlow:** Leveraged TensorFlow library for building, training, and evaluating the model.
**Image Preprocessing:** Applied appropriate preprocessing techniques to enhance the model's learning process.
**Classification Accuracy**: Achieved high accuracy in classifying images as either containing a horse or a human.
**Model Evaluation:** Conducted a thorough evaluation of the model's performance on a separate test dataset.
## Usage
